# Monitoring Jenkins

Monitoring your Jenkins instance is crucial for maintaining its health, optimizing resource usage, and identifying potential issues proactively. Here are some key aspects and tools for monitoring Jenkins effectively:

## Logs

Jenkins system logs provide vital information about the health and operation of your Jenkins instance. They are essential for troubleshooting and identifying issues at the system level. Build logs, on the other hand, are specific to individual job executions.

### Custom Log Recorders

You can create custom log recorders to filter and group relevant information from Jenkins logs, reducing noise and focusing on critical events. To create custom log recorders, navigate to **Manage Jenkins > System Log > Log Recorders**.

## Monitor Nodes

Monitoring nodes (agents) in Jenkins helps ensure they are healthy and available for job executions.

### NodeMonitor Tool

Use NodeMonitor to perform health checks on nodes, reporting on:

- CPU and memory usage
- Disk space availability

Additional checks can be added through plugins. When a node is down or in poor condition, Jenkins suspends job executions on that node until it recovers. Admins can set up alerts for node issues.

## Monitor Executors and Node Usage

### Load Statistics

Navigate to **Manage Jenkins > Load Statistics** to monitor executor utilization. This provides insights into:

- Number of online executors
- Number of busy executors
- Number of available executors
- Queue length (jobs waiting for an executor)

Use this data to determine if additional nodes or executors are needed to optimize Jenkins throughput.

## Metrics

Jenkins provides out-of-the-box metrics for monitoring various aspects such as build times and agent-related metrics.

### Metric Aggregator Service

For comprehensive monitoring and reporting, consider using a metric aggregator service to consolidate Jenkins metrics into a single dashboard or report. This helps in gaining a holistic view of Jenkins performance and resource usage.

**Note:** Detailed configuration of metric aggregators is beyond the scope of this class.

Monitoring your Jenkins instance regularly ensures optimal performance, early issue detection, and effective resource management.

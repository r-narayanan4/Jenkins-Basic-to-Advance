# Jenkins Security Best Practices

## Introduction

Securing your Jenkins environment is crucial to protect sensitive information and prevent malicious attacks. Jenkins, being a distributed build system, requires careful security management to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your resources.

## Security Concepts

### Major Principles

1. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal privileges necessary for users and processes. Avoid unnecessary permissions and open ports.
   
2. **Know the System**: Understanding how Jenkins and its components work enhances your ability to secure them effectively.
   
3. **Defense in Depth**: Implement security measures across all layers of your Jenkins environment.
   
4. **Prevention vs. Detection**: Proactively monitor Jenkins for security breaches to detect and respond promptly.
   
5. **Keep System Current**: Regularly apply security updates to Jenkins and plugins to protect against vulnerabilities.

### Principle of Least Privilege

- **Authentication**: Control access to Jenkins.
  
- **Authorization**: Define permissions for actions within Jenkins.
  
- **Accounting**: Monitor and audit Jenkins to ensure compliance and detect anomalies.

## Understanding Jenkins Pipelines

### Pipeline Execution

- Pipelines execute with the privileges of the Jenkins administrator by default.
  
- Pipeline logic runs on the Jenkins controller, while build steps execute on agents.

### Security Considerations

- Malicious Pipelines can reconfigure Jenkins, delete files, or launch attacks.
  
- Trusted users inadvertently introducing malicious code is a risk.

## Agents and Security

- Agents executing on the controller node can access sensitive Jenkins files and configurations.
  
- For maximum security, run builds on ephemeral agents in the cloud, destroyed after job completion.

## Best Practices

- **Avoid Builds on Controller**: Never run builds on the Jenkins controller in production to prevent access to sensitive Jenkins files.
  
- **Use Credentials**: Securely manage access to external resources by storing credentials securely and using them in Pipelines without hardcoding.

## Next Steps

Explore Jenkins security provisions:

- Authentication and authorization settings.
- Monitoring tools for detecting security breaches.
- Administering global security settings.
- Managing credentials securely.
- Applying security updates promptly.

Understanding and implementing these practices will help secure your Jenkins environment effectively.
